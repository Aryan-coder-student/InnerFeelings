Today started like any other day in space, with the sunriseâ€”well, one of the sixteen we experience each day up here. Waking up to the sight of the Earth below never gets old. The blues of the oceans and the swirls of white clouds are simply breathtaking.

After a quick breakfast of rehydrated scrambled eggs and coffee (which behaves more like a blob of liquid in microgravity), I floated over to the lab module to begin my work. Today's tasks included monitoring a biology experiment on plant growth in microgravity. We're trying to understand how different plant species adapt to space, which is crucial for long-duration missions to Mars and beyond. It's fascinating to see how the roots grow in all directions, not just downward like on Earth.

Mid-morning, I had a video conference with the mission control team back in Houston. We discussed the progress of our experiments and any adjustments needed. It's always great to see familiar faces and hear updates from Earth, even if it's just through a screen.

Lunch was a social affair with my fellow crew members. We shared some freeze-dried fruit and nuts while exchanging stories and experiences from back home. It's moments like these that remind me of the importance of camaraderie and teamwork in space.

In the afternoon, I spent a couple of hours on maintenance tasks. Keeping the ISS running smoothly is a constant effort, and today I worked on some routine checks of the life support systems. It's meticulous work, but it's vital for our safety and comfort.

Exercise is a big part of our daily routine to combat the muscle atrophy and bone loss that come with living in microgravity. I spent an hour on the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), which simulates weight training. It's always a workout, but I feel stronger and more energized afterward.

As the day wound down, I took some time to float by the Cupola, the ISS's observation module. Watching the Earth pass by below is a humbling experience. It's a stark reminder of the fragility and beauty of our planet.

Before heading to my sleep station, I spent some time writing in this journal and reading a book. It's important to have some personal time to unwind and reflect.

Living on the ISS is a unique experience, filled with challenges and rewards. Every day brings new discoveries and a deeper appreciation for our home planet. I feel incredibly lucky to be part of this journey and to contribute to our understanding of space and its impact on human life.

Goodnight from orbit
